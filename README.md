ImGui SDL2+OpenGL3 Visualization
This project provides a visualization and data acquisition application using ImGui, SDL2, and OpenGL. The application includes real-time plotting capabilities for linear and angular velocities and visualizes yaw values with arrows.

Features
Real-time plotting of linear and angular velocities.
Visualization of odom yaw values with arrow representation.
Keyboard input handling for specific keys (W, S, X, A, D, Z, C, Q, E).
Requirements
SDL2
ImGui
ImPlot
MinGW (for Windows) or appropriate GCC compiler (for Linux/Mac)

Setup
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies (SDL2, ImGui, ImPlot) available in your project directory.

2. Code Structure
The main.cpp file includes:

UpdateValues(): Updates the simulated values for plotting.
PlotValues(): Plots linear and angular velocities.
DrawArrow(): Draws arrows representing yaw values.
PlotYaw(): Plots yaw values with arrows.
ProcessKeyboardInputs(): Processes keyboard inputs.
KeyboardInput(): Handles keyboard inputs to update values.

3. Modify tasks.json
Ensure your tasks.json is set up correctly for building the project with MinGW or appropriate GCC compiler:

            },
            "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
        }
    ]
}

4. Build and Run
Use the following command to build and run your application:

g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -std=c++2a -I. *.cpp -g -o main.exe -ld3d9 -ldwmapi -lgdi32
./main.exe

5. Usage
Toggle Linear Velocity Plot: Click the "velocity" button in the control panel.
Toggle Angular Velocity Plot: Click the "velocity" button in the control panel.
Toggle Yaw Plot: Click the "angleodom" button in the control panel.
Keyboard Inputs: Use keys W, S, X, A, D, Z, C, Q, E for respective actions.
Keyboard Inputs
The application handles the following keyboard inputs:

W: Increase linear velocity.
S: Decrease linear velocity.
X: Stop linear velocity.
A: Increase angular velocity.
D: Decrease angular velocity.
Z: Custom action.
C: Custom action.
Q: Custom action.
E: Custom action.
